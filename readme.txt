Allows administrators to globally disable comments on their site. Comments can be disabled according to post type. Multisite friendly.

== Description ==

This plugin allows administrators to globally disable comments on any post type (posts, pages, attachments, etc.) so that these settings cannot be overridden for individual posts. It also removes all comment-related fields from edit and quick-edit screens. On multisite installations, it can be used to disable comments on the entire network.

Additionally, comment-related items can be removed from the Dashboard, Widgets, the Admin Menu and the Admin Bar.

**Important note**: Use this plugin if you don't want comments at all on your site (or on certain post types). Don't use it if you want to selectively disable comments on individual posts - WordPress lets you do that anyway. If you don't know how to disable comments on individual posts, there are instructions in [the FAQ](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-comments/faq/).

If you come across any bugs or have suggestions, please use the plugin support forum or contact me at [rayofsolaris.net](http://rayofsolaris.net). I can't fix it if I don't know it's broken! Please check the [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-comments/faq/) for common issues.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is "persistent mode"? =

By default, the plugin does not make any persistent changes to your posts - it just dynamically closes comments on them. This means that you can use the plugin temporarily and restore comment statuses when you disable it. If the plugin works in this mode, then I recommend that you don't use persistent mode.

Unfortunately some themes do not properly check the comment status of posts, and the plugin in default mode will have no effect with them (comments will still appear to be open). To fix this, switch to persistent mode. Note however that this will make persistent changes: **comments will remain closed even if you later disable the plugin** (you can always reopen them manually, of course).

**I repeat, using persistent mode will make changes to your database. DO NOT USE IT IF YOU WANT TO DISABLE COMMENTS TEMPORARILY.**

**Network Administrators**: If you want to prevent individual site administrators from using persistent mode, hook into the `disable_comments_allow_persistent_mode` filter and return `false`. This will prevent the option from being visible to site administrators.

= Nothing happens after I disable comments on all posts - comment forms still appear when I view my posts. =

This is because your theme is not checking the comment status of posts in the correct way. The solution is to switch the plugin to persistent mode (the last option on the plugin settings page).

You may like to point your theme's author to [this explanation](http://rayofsolaris.net/blog/2012/how-to-check-if-comments-are-allowed-in-wordpress) of what they are doing wrong, and how to fix it.

= How can I remove the text that says "comments are closed" at the bottom of articles where comments are disabled? =

With most newer themes (including Wordpress' bundled themes), this message will not appear when you use this plugin, because the plugin notifies them that comments are not just disabled, but unsupported.

If your theme still displays the message, you will have to edit its files manually to remove it. Two common approaches are to either delete or comment out the relevant lines in `wp-content/your-theme/comments.php`, or to add a declaration to `wp-content/your-theme/style.css` that hides the message from your visitors. In either case, make you you know what you are doing!

= I only want to disable comments on certain posts, not globally. What do I do? =

For starters, don't install this plugin!

Go to the edit page for the post you want to disable comments on. Scroll down to the "Discussion" box, where you will find the comment options for that post. If you don't see a "Discussion" box, then click on "Screen Options" at the top of your screen, and make sure the "Discussion" checkbox is checked.

You can also bulk-edit the comment status of multiple posts from the [posts screen](http://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Screen).

== Details ==

The plugin provides the option to **completely disable the commenting feature in WordPress**. When this option is selected, the following changes are made:

* All "Comments" links are hidden from the Admin Menu and Admin Bar;
* All comment-related sections ("Recent Comments", "Discussion" etc.) are hidden from the WordPress Dashboard;
* All comment-related widgets are disabled (so your theme cannot use them);
* The "Discussion" settings page is hidden;
* All comment RSS/Atom feeds are disabled (and requests for these will be redirected to the parent post);
* The X-Pingback HTTP header is removed from all pages;
* Outgoing pingbacks are disabled.

**Please delete any existing comments on your site before applying this setting, otherwise (depending on your theme) those comments may still be displayed to visitors.**
