**DISABLE COMMENTS VIA XML-RPC And REST API**
Block any comments made on your WordPress website via XML-RPC specification and REST API.

**Important note**: Use this plugin if you don't want comments at all on your site (or on certain post types). Don't use it if you want to selectively disable comments on individual posts - WordPress lets you do that anyway. If you don't know how to disable comments on individual posts, there are instructions in **[the FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/#faq).**

If you come across any bugs or have suggestions, please use the plugin support forum. I can't fix it if I don't know it's broken! Please check the **[FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/#faq)** for common issues.

Want to contribute? Here's the **[GitHub development repository](https://github.com/WPDevelopers/disable-comments)**.

A [must-use version](https://github.com/WPDevelopers/disable-comments-mu) of the plugin is also available.

### Advanced Configuration

Some of the plugin’s behavior can be modified by site administrators and plugin/theme developers through code:

* Define `DISABLE_COMMENTS_REMOVE_COMMENTS_TEMPLATE` and set it to `false` to prevent the plugin from replacing the theme's comment template with an empty one.

* Define `DISABLE_COMMENTS_ALLOW_DISCUSSION_SETTINGS` and set it to `true` to prevent the plugin from hiding the Discussion settings page.

These definitions can be made either in your main `wp-config.php` or in your theme's `functions.php` file.

== Installation ==

= Modern Way: =
1. Go to the WordPress Dashboard "Add New Plugin" section.
2. Search For "Disable Comments".
3. Install, then Activate it.
4. The plugin settings can be accessed via the 'Settings' menu in the administration area (either your site administration for single-site installs, or your network administration for network installs).

= Old Way: =
1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. The plugin settings can be accessed via the 'Settings' menu in the administration area (either your site administration for single-site installs, or your network administration for network installs).



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Nothing happens after I disable comments on all posts - comment forms still appear when I view my posts. =

This is because your theme is not checking the comment status of posts in the correct way.

You may like to point your theme's author to [this explanation](https://wpdeveloper.com/wordpress-posts-have-comments-allowed/) of what they are doing wrong, and how to fix it.

= How can I remove the text that says "comments are closed" at the bottom of articles where comments are disabled? =

The plugin tries its very best to hide this (and any other comment-related) messages.

If you still see the message, then it means your theme is overriding this behaviour, and you will have to edit its files manually to remove it. Two common approaches are to either delete or comment out the relevant lines in `wp-content/your-theme/comments.php`, or to add a declaration to `wp-content/your-theme/style.css` that hides the message from your visitors. In either case, make you you know what you are doing!

= I only want to disable comments on certain posts, not globally. What do I do? =

Go to the edit page for the post you want to disable comments on. Scroll down to the "Discussion" box, where you will find the comment options for that post. If you don't see a "Discussion" box, then click on "Screen Options" at the top of your screen, and make sure the "Discussion" checkbox is checked.

You can also bulk-edit the comment status of multiple posts from the [posts screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Screen).

= I want to delete comments from my database. What do I do? =

Go to the tools page for the Disable Comments plugin and utlize the Delete Comments tool to delete all comments or according to the specified post types from your database.
